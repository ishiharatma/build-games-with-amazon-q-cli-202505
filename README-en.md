## Project Overview

This project was created as part of the "Build Games with Amazon Q CLI and score a T shirt" event. It's a Puyo Puyo-style puzzle game called "AmaQ Puyo" built using Python and Pygame, with development assistance from Amazon Q CLI.

## Game Features

### Basic Gameplay
- Puyo Puyo-style falling puzzle game
- Match 4 or more of the same color to clear them
- Chain reactions for higher scores
- Level progression based on score

### Visual Elements
- Falling prediction display with semi-transparent circles
- Pop animations when pieces are cleared
- AWS-themed background with floating clouds
- Stylized title screen with "„ÅÇ„Åæ„Å∑„ÇàÔºÅÔºÅ" (AmaQ Puyo)

1. Implementing basic game mechanics
2. Adding visual enhancements and animations
3. Implementing chain reaction systems
4. Creating UI elements and screens
5. Bug fixing and optimization
6. Adding polish and final touches

## Development Environment
